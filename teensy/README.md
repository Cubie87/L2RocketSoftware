# Teensy Code

This code is quite poor. There was an unexpected issue that was detected 12 hours prior to launch and unfortunately I had to scrap all prior code. 

Most of this code is made up of example sketches that are copied and pasted over. 


If you do not wish to manually download the dependencies, copy the libraries folder to wherever the arduino third party libraries folder is in your system (Windows is under `Documents>Arduino`). (this is only tested in Arduino IDE 1.8.9)

Note that you will still need to install the TeensyDuino Bootloader.
