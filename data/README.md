# Flight Data

The flight data that was recorded during the launch. Note that the logging electronics were powered on before being placed on the launchpad. This was safe, as these electronics were electrically isolated from the pyrotechnic chargers.


## Significant Events

Launch occurs at line 111003, with apogee occuring around 111263. Landing occurs around line 112788.

## Post-flight Analysis

Rocket reached a ground altitude of 1560 m with a max acceleration during launch of 104 m/s^2 (10.6g). The highest speed calculated is around 249 m/s (Mach 0.72).

When plotted, it can be observed that the barometric pressure spikes due to drogue chute deploy at apogee, and again at around 300m. Unfortunately the main chute did not deploy, hence the constant vertical velocity after the second attempted chute deploy. Landing was thus significantly harder than expected (peaking above 4g, potentially above 10g), but with an intact rocket that can fly again, L2 certification was obtained!
